# Imagine QA

This is a private repo where I took a Production hybrid(on-prem/cloud) system and created a QA system fully in the cloud. This was using Imagine Communcations Versio Automation Media Asset Management software. 

The terraform config that I wrote will easily standup/breakdown the system at will. Golden AMIs have been created within AWS in a private repo under AMC's account. This repo will serve as a mere reference and should not be duplcated as licenses will need to be bought. 

The architecture of the system is shown in the diagram below:
